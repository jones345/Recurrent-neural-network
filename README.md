What is a Neural Network?

Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning that form the foundation of deep learning algorithms. Neural Networks are a collection of algorithms that are designed to recognize patterns and are modeled after the human brain. They interpret sensory data by labeling or clustering raw input using machine perception. They can recognize numerical patterns contained in vectors, which must be translated into all real-world data (images, sound, text, or time series).

ANNs consist of a node layers, which contain an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer. Every node, or artificial neuron, has a weight and threshold and is connected to a different one. When the output of a single node exceeds the specified threshold, the node is turned on and the data is sent to the next network layer. Otherwise, the next network layer will not receive data.



Neural networks use training data for the development and over time improvement of their accuracy. But once these algorithms are accurately targeted, they are powerful tools in computer science and artificial intelligence that enable us to high-speed classify and compile data. Speech recognition or image recognition tasks may take minutes to hours compared to human experts' manual identification. The search algorithm from Google is one of the most well-known neural networks.

How a Neural Network Works?
There are many layers in a neural network. A specific function is performed in each layer, and the complex the network, the more the layers. That is why a multilayer perception is also known as a neural network.

The purest form of a neural network has three layers:
Input layer — initial data for the neural network.
Hidden layers — intermediate layer between input and output layer and place where all the computation is done.
Output layer — produce the result for given inputs.




On the picture above there are 3 yellow circles. They show the input layer and are typically marked as vector X. The hidden layers are composed of four blue and four green circles. The "activation" nodes in these circles are normally noted as W or θ. The red circle is the output layer (or the values for several output classes/types) or the predicted value.

The next layer has every node and weight of each connection (black arrow). Each node is connected with each node. The impact of this node on the next layer of the node can be seen in weight. So if we look at a node it looks like:



 
 
What is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)?


A recurring neural network (RNN, or "Recurrent Neural Networks") is a kind of neural network that uses sequential data or time series data. It is a profoundly-learned algorithm that can be used as a linguistic translation, natural speech processing (NLP), speech recognition and image captioning. Recurring neural networks use training data, like feedforward and convolutionary neural networks (CNNs). It is distinguished by its "memory" because it uses previous inputs to influence the current input and output. Traditional deep-neural networks assume that each input and output is independent.Recurring neural network output depends on prior sequence elements. While future events would also help in determining the output of a particular sequence, these events are not taken into account in their predictions by the unidirectional recurring neural networks.
